# YoinkNFT
Are you tired of `Right Click > Save Image As...` to yoink an NFT 🤮?
Well suffer no more, because YoinkNFT is here to help you yoink NFTs... ✨on-chain✨!
YoinkNFT is here to (de)revolutionize the NFTs and further decentralize the ownership of NFTs. You might be the owner of an NFT... but you are the owner only according to one ERC721 smart contract. Now anybody else can own the same JPG according to this smart contract! Heck, it doesn't even matter if your JPG is hosted on google drive, dropbox or anywhere else...
Enjoy the freedom of using YoinkNFT!
